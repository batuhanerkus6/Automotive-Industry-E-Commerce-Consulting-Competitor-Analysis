# Automotive-Industry-E-Commerce-Consulting-Competitor-Analysis

In this project, I tried to do an SEO study by considering the posts on the websites of the institutions that provide services such as website design, advertising activities, financial and managerial consultancy to customers engaged in E-Commerce in the Automotive Industry, especially in spare parts.

All data used in this project was obtained through web-scraping. After being obtained, it is cleaned, normalized and arranged. Afterwards, data analysis was performed, and outputs that could benefit were identified and presented with data visualization tools.

The "data.csv" file keeps the headers in the examined URLs in raw form.
The "common_words_in_titles.csv" file is the cleaned up version of the "data.csv" file.
The "key_words.csv" file has stored all the text in the corresponding URLs. It is raw and needs methods such as cleaning, normalizing, grouping and filtering in order to be used.

Libraries used in the project:
requests
BeautifulSoup
pandas
os
collections
wordcloud
matplotlib
re
nltk.corpus
seaborn
